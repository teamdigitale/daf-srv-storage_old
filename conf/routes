# An example controller showing a sample home page
GET     /                           controllers.HomeController.redirectDocs

GET     /swagger.json               controllers.ApiHelpController.getResources
GET   /docs/                        controllers.HomeController.redirectDocs
GET   /docs/*file                   controllers.Assets.at(path="/public/swagger-ui",file)


# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.versioned(path="/public", file: Asset)

# Must: Do Not Use URI Versioning [115] http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/#115

GET     /datasets/:uri                    controllers.DatasetController.dataset(uri: String)

GET     /datasets/:uri/schema             controllers.DatasetController.schema(uri: String)


# More generally: POST should be used for scenarios that cannot be covered by the other methods sufficiently.
# For instance, GET with complex (e.g. SQL like structured) query
# that needs to be passed as request body payload because of the URL-length constraint.
# In such cases, make sure to document the fact that POST is used as a workaround.
POST    /datasets/:uri/search           controllers.DatasetController.search(uri: String)
